# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It ensures that only authorized entities can access resources or perform certain actions.

## Session Authentication

Session authentication is a method of authentication where the user's identity is verified once, and then a session is established for a period of time. During this session, the user can access resources without having to re-authenticate for each request. Session authentication typically involves the use of session tokens or cookies to maintain the authenticated state.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser stores these cookies and sends them back to the server with each subsequent request. Cookies are commonly used for session management, personalization, and tracking user behavior.

## Sending Cookies

Servers can send cookies to the client by setting the `Set-Cookie` header in the HTTP response. For example:

Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT; HttpOnly

This sets a cookie named `session_id` with the value `abc123`. The `Expires` attribute specifies when the cookie should expire, and the `HttpOnly` attribute instructs the browser to prevent client-side scripts from accessing the cookie.

## Parsing Cookies

On the server-side, you can access the cookies sent by the client in the `Cookie` header of the HTTP request. For example, in a Python Flask application, you can access the cookies like this:

from flask import request

## Get the value of the 'session_id' cookie

session_id = request.cookies.get('session_id')

This retrieves the value of the `session_id` cookie sent by the client. You can then use this value to manage the user's session or perform other authentication-related tasks.
